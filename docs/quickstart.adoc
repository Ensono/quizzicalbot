== Quickstart

The repository contains a Docker compose file that will run the two APIs for the application so that it can be tested locally to see the sort of responses that are returned.

There are a number of environment variables that need to be configured to run the application. The following table defines the variables that need to be set before running the compose command.

include::includes/envvars.adoc[]

Create a file for the environment at `local/envfile` with appropriate values for the variables as detailed in the table above.

The file that controls how Docker Compose will bring up the services is `compose.yaml`. The file contains two services, one for the Question API and one for the Upload API. By default it will attempt to build the images locally and then run them. However if a container engine is not installed, a pre-built image can be used. Please edit the `compose.yaml` file to determine how the service images are retrieved.

Once the containers are running the OpenAPI documentation for each service can be access using the relevant URLs:

As can be seen from the OpenAPI documentation, there is now an "Authorize" button. This can be used to add in the API Key that has been configured for the application. The API Key is configured in the `local/envfile` file. The value of the `API_KEY` variable is the API Key that needs to be entered into the "Authorize" dialog.
