== Uploading Documents

So that the OpenAI engine has information to work with the Azure Cognitive services need to be seeded with documents. The Upload API will be a single file (either a text file or a zip of files) and upload them to the server.

After the upload is complete the response will be returned, however in the background the file will be unpacked, if it is a zip file, and the relevant documents will be uploaded to blob storage.

NOTE: Currently rhe API does not inform the data source indexer to run to get the new documents, this currently has to be done manually in the Azure Portal.

The payload for the API call is just a file, but it must be one of:

    - "application/x-zip-compressed",
    - "application/pdf",
    - "application/msword",
    - "text/plain",
    - "text/markdown",
    - "text/asciidoc"

A folder name must be specified on the path. This is used within blob storage to provide context for which documents are used to answer the question.
